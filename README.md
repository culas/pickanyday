# PickAnyDay 📆

This project is an exploration into the complexity of basic date-picker functionality, without relying on any third-party library.
The corresponding UI is made with Angular, other than that all logic was built directly with plain JS APIs.
This "date-picker" is not supposed to be feature-complete or fulfill advanced requirements.
